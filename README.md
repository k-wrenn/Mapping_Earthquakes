# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between magnitudes of earthquakes within the last 7 days worldwide. An API was used to access a URL for GeoJSON data from the USGS website. The location and magnitude of each earthquake is added to a map. JavaScript and D3.js library were used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox through the API request and an inteactive map was created for the earthquake data.

The user can toggle between different layers such as tectonic plate display, display of all earthquakes, or display of major earthquakes only. For this project, an earthquake with a magnitude greater than 4.5 is considered a major earthquake. The user can also choose from different map back drops such as street, satellite, and dark. 

Each earthquake is represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. A legend is located in the lower right hand corner depicting the differnt colors associated with different magnitudes. In addition, each earthquake has a popup that, when clicked, will show the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
